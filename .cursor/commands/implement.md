# Implement the following plan
Follow the `Instructions` to implement the `Plan` then `Report` the completed work.

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT

**YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT WORKFLOW - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

1. **VERIFY PLAN EXISTS** - The plan should already exist in `specs/*.md` from a previous `/bug`, `/chore`, or `/feature` command
2. **READ THE PLAN FIRST** - Read and understand the complete plan before starting implementation
3. **FOLLOW THE PLAN EXACTLY** - Execute the plan step-by-step as written
4. **VALIDATE AS YOU GO** - Run validation commands from the plan to ensure no regressions

**BEFORE STARTING IMPLEMENTATION, VERIFY:**
- [ ] A plan document exists in `specs/*.md`
- [ ] I have read and understood the complete plan
- [ ] I will follow the plan's "Step by Step Tasks" in order
- [ ] I will run all "Validation Commands" from the plan
- [ ] I will report the completed work as specified

**IF NO PLAN EXISTS, STOP AND CREATE ONE FIRST USING `/bug`, `/chore`, OR `/feature`.**

## Instructions
- **VERIFY PLAN EXISTS** - Check that the plan file exists in `specs/*.md`. If not, stop and create it first.
- Read the plan completely, think hard about the plan and implement the plan.
- Follow the "Step by Step Tasks" section exactly as written, in order.
- Run all "Validation Commands" from the plan to ensure zero regressions.
