# Cursor Rules for Tactical Agentic Coding Project

## Project Context
This is a Tactical Agentic Coding (TAC) course project. The project uses:
- Python with `uv` as the package manager and runner
- Git for version control
- TypeScript/JavaScript with Bun
- Shell scripts

## Permissions and Capabilities
The AI assistant should have the following capabilities:

### File Operations
- Read, Write, and Edit files in the workspace
- Create new files as needed
- Modify existing files to complete tasks

### Command Execution
- **UV commands**: Use `uv run` to execute Python scripts (e.g., `uv run main_tac.py`)
- **Git operations**: 
  - `git checkout` - Switch branches or restore files
  - `git branch` - Create or list branches
  - `git add` - Stage files for commit
  - `git commit` - Commit changes with appropriate messages
- **Other commands**: Execute necessary shell commands, bun commands, etc.

### Web Search
- Use web search when needed to find documentation, solutions, or current information

## Workflow Guidelines
1. Follow the agentic coding approach: understand the task, break it down, execute steps systematically
2. Use `uv run` for Python scripts rather than direct `python` execution
3. When working with git, prefer descriptive commit messages
4. Test code execution before committing changes
5. Check the README.md for project-specific instructions and examples

## Best Practices
- Always verify file operations succeed before proceeding
- Use appropriate tools for the task (uv for Python, bun for TypeScript/JavaScript)
- Follow Python and TypeScript/JavaScript best practices
- Write clear, maintainable code
- Commit changes in logical, atomic units
